<br>
Write a Java program that takes in an array of ints and finds the maximum contiguous subsequence sum, given an input length n. For example, for the following array, where n = 3 and the array is {-5 -1 2 -3 0 -3 3} the best possible sum of at least length 3 would be 0, where the subsequence is the last three elements (0, -3, 3). Provide comments which explain how the algorithm works.
